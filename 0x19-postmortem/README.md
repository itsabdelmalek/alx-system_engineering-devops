Outage Postmortem: Cloud Storage Service

Issue Summary:
    Duration: 2 hours, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM (UTC)
    Impact: Cloud storage service experienced intermittent availability, affecting 50% of our users. File uploads and downloads were significantly delayed.
    Root Cause: Network congestion and misconfigured load balancer.

Timeline:

    9:00 AM: Issue detected when users reported slow response times during file uploads.
    9:10 AM: Monitoring alerts triggered due to increased API response times.
    9:15 AM: Engineering team initiated investigation into the cloud storage service.
    9:30 AM: Initial assumption was a potential database bottleneck; database team was engaged for analysis.
    9:45 AM: Database team confirmed database performance was not the issue; attention shifted to network and load balancing.
    10:00 AM: Discovered misconfigured load balancer leading to uneven distribution of traffic.
    10:15 AM: Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
    11:00 AM: Service fully restored, response times normalized.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: Network congestion combined with a misconfigured load balancer led to uneven distribution of traffic, causing slowdowns in file uploads and downloads.
    Resolution: Adjusted load balancer settings to ensure even distribution of traffic, alleviating network congestion.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Implement automated checks to monitor load balancer configurations for potential misconfigurations.
    Conduct regular performance tests to identify and address potential bottlenecks in the network infrastructure.
    Develop a protocol for rapid response and escalation in case of network-related issues.

let's acknowledge that even the most advanced tech can sometimes suffer from a case of the Mondays! ðŸ˜…
